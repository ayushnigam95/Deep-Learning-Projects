## >> Building the Neural Network in parts ## 

## Main steps involved in building a Neural Network are as follows:
## 1. Defining the model structure (such as number of input features) 
## 2. Initializing the model's parameters
## 3. Going through following Loop:
##    - Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
##    - Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
##   - Update parameters (gradient descent)
